Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existenceof beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent âgrand designâor does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of lifeitself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meetâif only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and LeonardMlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explainthat according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied tothe universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the âtop-downâmultiverseâthe idea that ours is just one of many universes that appearedspontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a âmodel-dependentâtheory ofeverything.âand provokeâlike no other. ,http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/../../media/cache/9b/69/9b696c2064d6ee387774b6121bb4be91.jpg
